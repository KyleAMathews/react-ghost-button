# react-ghost-button
A simple react-ghost-button

This is a rather opionated ghost button plus perhaps heavier than you'd
like. It relies on some JS/Color trickery to adjust its animation/colors to your
background.

As it's rather simple, if this component isn't to your liking, hopefully
it'll serve as a useful guide to building your own.

## Install
`npm install react-ghost-button`

## Usage

```javascript
<GhostButton
  background="yellow"
  color="blue"
/>
```
